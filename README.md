This is an experimental port of [TheWaveWarden/odin2](https://github.com/TheWaveWarden/odin2) to [aap-juce](https://github.com/atsushieno/aap-juce/).

It builds and the UI shows up, but there is a bunch of changes in the code (e.g. had to kill all those synchronous dialogs) and it isn't probably fully working yet.

It works for PluginPreview and MidiDeviceService (via kmmk).
